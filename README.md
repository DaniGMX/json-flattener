# JSON Flattener
This is a JSON flattener script written in Kotlin that flattens embedded objects inside a given JSON object.

## How to run the program
In order to run the script, run `kotlinc src/main/kotlin/main.kt` at root project level. This can be done by:
1. Clone the repository in the directory of choice.
2. Open a terminal and navigate until project root level.
3. Run `kotlinc src/main/kotlin/main.kt` command.

## Libraries used
In order to manage JSON Strings, I used Google's GSON library.

## Time required to make this script
It took me around 150 minutes total to finish this project.
